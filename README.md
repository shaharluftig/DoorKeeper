DoorKeeper is a simple and easy to use application that allows you to alert every time someone is passing through your IP Camera.

Feel free to fork and make contributions. Iâ€™ll try to get them into the main application.


### Installation
##### using telegram-bot notifier

1. Create a Telegram bot using this tutorial: https://medium.com/@ManHay_Hong/how-to-create-a-telegram-bot-and-send-messages-with-python-4cf314d9fa3e
2. Fill Telegram Bot Token and Chat ID under ./Config/__init__
3. set IP_CAMERA_URL to your ip camera ip (I used IP Webcam android app) under docker-compose.yml, for example "http://192.168.1.24:8080/video"
4. Add images to ./Images folder, and set the name of each image to person name
5. Run docker-compose up

### Development
#### Todos in the near future

 - Add tests
